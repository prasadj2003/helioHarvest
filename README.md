## 🌞 Harnessing Solar Potential with HelioHarvest

HelioHarvest is an innovative application designed to analyze solar potential using geospatial data and advanced mapping technologies. By leveraging real-time weather data and interactive mapping tools, HelioHarvest provides accurate insights into solar energy feasibility for a given area.

## 🚀 Features

* **📍 Real-Time Geolocation**: Automatically fetches the user's location to provide localized solar data.
* **📐 Interactive Polygon Drawing**: Users can draw areas on the map to calculate solar potential.
* **🌍 Mapbox Integration**: Provides satellite imagery and interactive tools for precise mapping.
* **🌦️ Weather & Irradiation Data**: Retrieves real-time weather and solar irradiation data for better analysis.
* **📊 Visual Analytics**: Displays solar potential in an easy-to-understand graphical format.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

### **Frontend**
* React.js
* Tailwind CSS
* Mapbox GL
* @mapbox/mapbox-gl-draw
* Turf.js
* Axios
* Chart.js
* React Router

### **Backend**
* Node.js
* Express.js
* Axios
* CORS

## 📖 How It Works

1. The user allows location access or manually inputs coordinates.
2. The application fetches the current location and overlays it on a satellite map.
3. Users draw polygons on the map to define an area.
4. The system calculates the solar potential using irradiation data and displays it.
